# REDCap Chatbot

This EM integrates a Support Chat Bot UI widget into our Stanford REDCap instance.

### About the Chatbot

The REDCap Chatbot is a globally installed EM that enhances REDCap's UI by injecting a user-friendly chat widget directly into REDCap pages.
Users can easily interact with the chatbot inline on their project pages, receiving immediate support for their REDCap-related queries.

### Integration and Dependencies

The chatbot operates alongside two essential external modules:
1. **SecureChatAI EM**: Provides the backend for secure and efficient AI interactions with Stanford's Secure GPT API. More details can be found in the [SecureChatAI EM repository](https://github.com/susom/secureChatAI).
2. **RedcapRAG EM**: Manages relevant data and context to ensure the chatbot provides accurate and helpful answers. More details can be found in the [RedcapRAG repository](https://github.com/susom/RedcapRAG).
