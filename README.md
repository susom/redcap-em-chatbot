# REDCap Chatbot

This is an External Module (EM) designed for system-wide distribution to introduce a frontend REDCap Support Chat Bot code.

### About the Chatbot

The chatbot is a standalone PHP/REACT-based app, functioning as a REDCap External Module. Its code repository can be found [here](https://github.com/susom/redcap-em-chatbot). It operates in tandem with the comprehensive [SecureChatAI EM](https://github.com/susom/secureChatAI).

### Content of this EM

The frontend REACT component is programmed to produce static build files which can be incorporated into the DOM of an external website for more seamless UI integration. This EM will be enabled universally, incorporating these build files into REDCap's UI. Note, this UI will continue to interact with Stanford's dedicated Secure Chat AI instance.
