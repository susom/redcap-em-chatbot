These rates are negotiated between Stanford and the Office of Naval Research (ONR). All proposals must include budget requests for these costs using the negotiated rates, unless a reduced rate is approved on a case-by-case basis. The Office of the Dean of Research maintains a list of sponsors with pre-approved lower rates.",

If a project is directly charged for leased space, it is considered off-campus. Teleworking from a residence does not qualify a project as off-campus because Stanford's operating costs continue to be incurred.",

For awards under $100,000 in MTDC, the rate is determined by where the majority (over 50%) of costs are expended. For awards of $100,000 or more in MTDC, the costs are apportioned between on- and off-campus rates, but only if the lesser component is 20% or more of the total MTDC. If the lesser component is under 20%, the rate of the larger component applies to the entire project.",
