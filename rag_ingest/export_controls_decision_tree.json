          "content": "This tool is a questionnaire designed to determine if export controls apply to a specific activity. It guides the user through a series of 'Yes' or 'No' questions about sharing, shipping, or transferring items, information, or software. The answers lead to a determination of whether an export control license may be needed and provide guidance on next steps.",

Is the export compliant with Stanford's Openness in Research policy? Is the Fundamental Research Exclusion available? Do U.S. trade sanctions apply?",
