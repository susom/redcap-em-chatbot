Information that can be pulled from Cayuse includes: Sponsor, Key Personnel, Subaward institutions, Proposal Dates, Title, CFDA/Opportunity numbers, Budget Amount, and answers to compliance questions (Human Subjects, Animal Subjects, etc.). The amount of data transferred depends on the completeness of the Cayuse application forms, such as the SF 424 RR and RR Key Persons forms.",
