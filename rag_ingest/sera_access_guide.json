        "content": "Anyone with an active SUNet ID can automatically access SeRA. This default access allows a user to initiate a proposal or a Research Related Agreement (RRA) for themselves or on behalf of any Stanford investigator. It also allows them to access specific project records they have initiated or been granted access to, and to run several reports like the Current and Pending Support report.",

        "heading": "SeRA Department Administrator Access",
        "content": "This level of access is granted via the Authority Manager system and is intended for department research administrators. It can be configured for 'All Investigators' within an organization or for 'Specific Investigator(s)'. Access for 'All Investigators' allows a user to act on all SeRA records under that org code, as well as records in other orgs that include an investigator from their specified org. The 'Specific Investigators' access, new as of August 2024, allows an administrator to act on all records for a particular investigator, regardless of the department.",

        "heading": "How to Grant Department Administrator Access",
        "content": "To grant this access, an authorized user must log into Authority Manager, select the person, and choose the 'Stanford Electronic Research Administration - Department Administrator' privilege. They then select the organization scope and the permission level ('All Investigators' or 'Specific Investigators'). For specific access, they must search for and add the individual investigators. It's important to note that to grant this authority, the grantor must have grantable authority for the investigator's home academic department.",

        "content": "Also granted in Authority Manager, this privilege allows individuals to receive all SeRA Notice of Award (NOA) emails for either 'All Investigators' or 'Specific Investigators' within a given organization. This is in addition to the PI and the Department Administrator on the PDRF, who always receive the NOA. The process for granting this is similar to the Department Administrator access, but the selected privilege is 'Stanford Electronic Research Administration: NOA Recipient'.",

        "heading": "SeRA PTA Manager Access",
        "content": "This access is used to view all SeRA Project-Task-Award (PTA) transactions for a specific unit or org. It is granted in Authority Manager by selecting the 'Self Service - SU PTA Manager Requester Sponsored' privilege. If the individual also needs to approve PTA transactions (like Early Account Requests), they must also be granted the 'Self Service - SU PTA Manager Approver Sponsored' privilege.",
