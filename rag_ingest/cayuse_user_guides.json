        "content": "Cayuse Proposals (S2S) is the system-to-system solution used by Stanford and over 150 peer institutions to prepare and submit federal applications to the Grants.gov portal. It is important to note that Stanford does NOT use the Grants.gov Workspace feature. If a funding announcement advises using Workspace, the application should still be prepared within Stanford's Cayuse system.",

        "content": "User access to Stanford's Cayuse system is granted by submitting a HelpSU ticket to the SeRA Support Team. Once access is granted, Cayuse can be accessed directly from the 'Navigate' dropdown menu within SeRA. If a user has previously used another institution's Cayuse instance, a new account will need to be created for them at Stanford. If prompted for Cayuse-specific login credentials, a HelpSU ticket should be submitted for assistance.",

To submit to the NSF, applicants must first self-register for an NSF account. Department administrators can also register for an NSF account to support their investigators.",

It is critical to note that Stanfordâ€™s Institutional Profile in Cayuse is maintained by OSR and should not be edited by users.",

        "content": "If a department elects to create and complete subaward form pages on behalf of a subrecipient institution, rather than importing them, the department must create both an institutional profile for the subrecipient and people profiles for all key subrecipient personnel within Stanford's Cayuse. This step is not necessary if the department will be importing completed subaward forms received from the subrecipient institution. The Cayuse Subawards Guide provides more detailed information.",
