        "content": "Anyone with an active SU Net ID can run the Disclosures/Current and Pending Support Report in SeRA. This report is intended as a starting point for preparing official Current and Pending (Other) Support documents and Biosketches for sponsors. It is NOT meant to be submitted as-is. The report gathers all available information from SeRA and provides a central place to manage an investigator's resources. Users should always follow the specific sponsor and solicitation guidance when preparing disclosure documents. The NIH, NSF, and DOD have specific requirements for disclosing foreign funding and talent recruitment programs.",

This includes Advisory Board Memberships, outside appointments, consulting activities, and in-kind support. Any modifications to this data must be made in OPACS. The report details whether consulting activities involve research, have the potential to impact the investigator's research portfolio, or involve contracts with confidentiality clauses, which is relevant for NSF disclosures.",
