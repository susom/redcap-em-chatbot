The Office of the VPDoR maintains a list of these pre-approved exceptions in the SeRA system. Stanford may accept a sponsor's lower rate if it is a written, publicly disclosed, and consistently applied policy, or if it's a condition of a specific solicitation. If a sponsor does not meet these criteria, a project-specific waiver is required. The university reserves the right to apply a higher rate if it becomes aware that a sponsor has paid a higher rate to another institution.",

A sponsor's desire to limit overhead on a single award is not sufficient grounds for a waiver. Waivers are not granted to fix incorrect cost classifications. Funding from foreign government agencies is not pre-approved and must be considered case-by-case.",
