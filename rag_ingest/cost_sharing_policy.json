          "content": "Cost sharing is the portion of total project costs not borne by the sponsor. It can be mandatory (required by the sponsor) or voluntary (not required, but offered in the proposal). Once an award is received with a cost-sharing commitment, it becomes a binding obligation for the university. Voluntary Uncommitted Cost Sharing refers to effort or costs contributed above what was agreed to in the award and is not tracked as a binding commitment. Matching is a form of cost sharing where the university must match sponsor funds with funds from another party.",

          "heading": "The Cost Sharing Commitment",
          "content": "When a PI proposes and the university agrees to cost share, it becomes a formal commitment that must be indicated on the Proposal Development Routing Form (PDRF). The PI is responsible for ensuring that voluntary cost sharing is permitted, that funds are available, and that all expenses are necessary, reasonable, and accounted for in compliance with university and sponsor requirements. The tracking and reporting of cost sharing are subject to audit.",

Note that for faculty with appointments less than 12 months, summer effort above 90% (95% for Research Faculty) cannot be cost-shared. 2) Equipment, but only if the award is contingent on such cost sharing (e.g., instrumentation grants). Otherwise, equipment should be listed as 'available for the performance of the sponsored agreement.' 3) Other direct costs like travel, lab supplies, and the university's contribution to graduate student tuition.",

PIs can include these automatically cost-shared F&A costs, as well as any waived F&A costs, in the proposal budget. For federal awards, including unrecovered F&A on cost sharing requires prior approval from the sponsoring agency.",

Non-federal award funds can be used only if allowed by both sponsors. Typically, funds come from gift, endowment income, operating budget, or other designated departmental funds.",
